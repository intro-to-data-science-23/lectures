# Automation

.pull-left-wide2[
### Motivation

- We spend [too much time](https://itchronicles.com/technology/repetitive-tasks-cost-5-trillion-annually/) on repetitive tasks.
- We're already automating using scripts that bundle multiple commands! Next step: The pipeline as a series of scripts and commands.
- Good pipelines are modular. But you don't want to trigger 10 scripts sequentially by hand.
- Some tasks are to be repeated on a regular basis (schedule).

### When automation makes sense

- The input is variable but the process of turning input into output is highly standardized.
- You use a diverse set of software to produce the output.
- Others (humans, machines) are supposed to run the analyses.
- Time saved by automation &gt;&gt; Time needed to automate.
]

.pull-right-small2[
### Different ways of doing it

We will consider automation

- using **R**,
- using the **Shell** and **RScript**,
- using **make**, and
- using dedicated **scheduling tools**.

# Thinking in pipelines

.pull-left[
### Key characteristics
- Pipelines make complex projects easier to handle because they break up a monolithic script into **discrete, manageable chunks**.
- If properly done, each stage of the pipeline defines its input and its outputs.
- Pipeline modules **do not modify their inputs** (*idempotence*). Rerunning one module produces the same results as the previous run.

### Key advantages
- When you modify one stage of the pipeline, you only have to rerun the downstream, dependent stages.
- Division of labor is straightforward.
- Modules tend to be a lot easier to debug.

# A data science pipeline is a graph

.pull-left-small2[
### Wait what
- Scripts and data files are vertices of the graph.
- Dependencies between stages are edges of the graph.
- Pipelines are not necessarily DAGS. Recursive routines are imaginable (but to be avoided?).
- Also, scripts are not necessarily hierarchical (e.g., multiple different modeling approaches of the same data in different scripts).
- An automation script gives *one* order in which you can successfully run the pipeline.

# Automation using pipelines in R

.pull-left[
### Motivation and usage
- The `source()` function reads and parses R code from a file or connection. 
- We can build a pipeline by sourcing scripts sequentially.
- This pipeline is usually stored in a "master" script.
- The removal of previous work is optional and maybe redundant. Often the data is overwritten by default.
- It is recommended that the individual scripts are (partial) standalones, i.e. that they import all data they need by default (loading the packages could be considered an exception). 
- Note that as long as the environment is not reset, it remains intact across scripts, which is a potential source of error and confusion.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Example

The master script `master.R`:


```r
R&gt; ## clean out any previous work
R&gt; outputs &lt;- c("lotr_raw.tsv",
+ 	          "lotr_clean.tsv",
+               list.files(pattern = "*.png$"))
R&gt; file.remove(outputs)
R&gt; 
R&gt; ## run scripts
R&gt; source("00-packages.R")
R&gt; source("01-download-data.R")
R&gt; source("02-process-data.R")
R&gt; source("03-plot.R")
```

# Automation using the Shell and Rscript

.pull-left[
### Motivation and usage
- Alternatively to using an R master script, we can also run the pipeline from the command line.
- Note that here, the environments don't carry over across `Rscript` calls. The scripts definitely have to run in a standalone fashion (i.e., load packages, import all necessary data, etc.).
- The working directory should be set either in the script(s) or in the shell with `cd`.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Example

The master script `master.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
cd /Users/simonmunzert/github/examples/02-automation-shell-rscript
set -eux
Rscript 01-download-data.R
Rscript 02-process-data.R
Rscript 03-plot.R
```

The `set` command allows to adjust some base shell parameters:
- `-e`: Stop at first error
- `-u`: Undefined variables are an error
- `-x`: Print each command as it is run

For more information on `set`, see [here](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html).

# Automation using Make

.pull-left-vwide[
### Motivation and usage
- [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29) is an automation tool that allows us to specify and manage build processes.
- It is commonly run via the shell.
- At the heart of a make operation is the `makefile` (or `Makefile`, `GNUmakefile`), a script which serves as a recipe for the building process.
- A `makefile` is written following a particular syntax and in a declarative fashion.
- Conceptually, the recipe describes which files are built how and using what input.

### Advantages of Make
- It looks at which files you have and automatically figures out how to create the files that you have. For complex pipelines this "automation of the automation process" can be very helpful.
- While shell scripts give *one* order in which you can successfully run the pipeline, Make will figure out the parts of the pipeline (and their order) that are needed to build a desired target.

# Automation using Make (cont.)

.pull-left-small[
### Basic syntax

Each batch of lines indicates 
- a file to be created (the target),
- the files it depends on (the prerequisites), and 
- set of commands needed to construct the target from the dependent files.

Dependencies propagate.
- To create any of the `png` figures, we need `lotr_clean.tsv`.
- If this file changes, the `png`s change as well when they're built.
]

.pull-right-wide[

### Example `makefile`

```bash
all: lotr_clean.tsv barchart-words-by-race.png words-histogram.png

lotr_raw.tsv:
	curl -L http://bit.ly/lotr_raw-tsv &gt; lotr_raw.tsv

lotr_clean.tsv: lotr_raw.tsv 02-process-data.R
	Rscript 02-process-data.R

barchart-words-by-race.png: lotr_clean.tsv 03-plot.R
	Rscript 03-plot.R

words-histogram.png: lotr_clean.tsv
	Rscript -e 'library(ggplot2); 
	qplot(Words, data = read.delim("$&lt;"), geom = "histogram"); 
	ggsave("$@")'
	rm Rplots.pdf

clean:
	rm -f lotr_raw.tsv lotr_clean.tsv *.png

```

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;While the basic syntax is simple (see right), the devil's in the detail. Check out resources listed on the next slide if you want to learn more.]

### Getting Make to run

- Using the command line, go into the directory for your project.
- Create the `Makefile` file.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
- The most basic Make commands are `make all` and `make clean` which builds (or deletes) all output as specified in the script.

# Automation using Make - FAQ

### Does it work on Windows?

To install an run `make` on Windows, check out [these instructions](https://stat545.com/make-windows.html).

### Where can I learn more?

If you consider working with Make, check out the [official manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html), [this helpful tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/), Karl Broman's [excellent minimal make introduction](https://kbroman.org/minimal_make/), or [this Stat545 piece](https://stat545.com/automation-overview.html). 

.pull-left-vwide[
### This is dusty technology. Are there alternatives?

In the context of data science with R, the `targets` package is an interesting option. It provides R functionality to define a Make-stype pipeline. Check out the [overview](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) and [manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).

# Scheduling scripts and processes

.pull-left-wide[
### Motivation
- So far, we have automated data science pipelines.
- But the execution of these pipelines still needs to be triggered.
- In some cases, it is desirable to also **automate the initialization** of R scripts (or any processes for that matter) **on a regular basis**, e.g. weekly, daily, on logon, etc.
- This makes particular sense when you have moving parts in your pipeline (most likely: data).

### Common scenarios for scheduling

1. You fetch data from the web on a regular basis (e.g., via scraping scripts or APIs).
2. You generate daily/weekly/monthly reports/tweets based on changing data.
3. You build an alert control system informing you about anomalies in a database.

### Scheduling options
- Schedule tasks on Windows with [Windows Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler).
- Manage them via a GUI (→ Control Panel) or the command line using `schtasks.exe`.
- The R package [`taskscheduleR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taskscheduleR/vignettes/taskscheduleR.html) provides a programmable R interface to the WTS.

### Scheduling options
- On macOS you can schedule background jobs using [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) and [`launchd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd).
- `launchd`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; was created by Apple as a replacement for the popular Linux utility `cron` ([deprecated](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html) but still usable). 
- The R package [`cronR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cronR/index.html) provides a programmable R interface.
- `cron` syntax for more complex scheduling:

# Writing an R package

.pull-left[
### The state of the R package ecosystem

- As of November 2021, the CRAN package repository features more than 18,000 packages.
- Many, many more are available on GitHub and other code sharing platforms.
- R has a vivid community that continuous to create and build extensions and maintain the existing environment. Many of them have much more training and time to invest in software development.
- So, why should we (and with that I mean YOU) write yet another R package?

# Why create another R package?

.pull-left-wide[
1. **Thinking in functions.** R is a functional programming language, and packages bundle functions. Thinking of projects as packages is consistent with a functional mindset.

2. **Automation and transportability.** By turning tasks into functions, you save repetitive typing, keep frequently-used code together, and let code travel across projects.

3. **Collaboration and transparency.** Packages are ideal to make functionality available to others, but also to let others contribute. As a side effect, it nudges you to document your functions properly and gives you the opportunity to let others review and improve your code easily. 

4. **Visibility and productization.** Publishing code in packages is potentially giving your project a big boost in visibility. Also, it is more likely to be perceived as a product than an insular project.

# An example walkthrough

&lt;br&gt;

In the following we will briefly study the process of creating a package. 

The [example](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/#section1) is taken from [Methods Bites](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/), the Blog of the MZES Social Science Data Lab, and developed by [Cosima Meyer](https://cosimameyer.rbind.io/) and [Dennis Hammerschmidt](http://dennis-hammerschmidt.rbind.io/). 


.pull-left-vwide[
The idea is to create a package `overviewR` that helps you to get an overview – hence, the name – of your data with particular emphasis on the extent that your distinct units of observation are covered for the entire time frame of your data set.

The package is [real](https://cosimameyer.github.io/overviewR/) and lives on both [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/overviewR/index.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/cosimameyer/overviewR). Check out the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/overviewR/vignettes/overviewR_vignette.html).

# Step 1: Idea and name

.pull-left-small3[
### Idea

- I'll leave you alone with that one.
- ... but you might want to check out the [over 18k existing ones that live on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).

### Name

- Package names can only be letters and numbers and must start with a letter.
- The package `available` helps you — both with getting inspiration for a name and with checking whether your name is available.
]

.pull-right-wide3[
### Example


```r
R&gt; library(available)
R&gt; # Check for potential names
R&gt; available::suggest("Easily extract information about sample")
```

```
   easilyr
```

```r
R&gt; # Check whether it's available
R&gt; available::available("overviewR", browse = FALSE)
```

```

# Step 2: Set up your package

.pull-left-small3[
### Option 1: via RStudio and GitHub

- Use RStudio's Project Wizard and click on `File` &gt; `New Project...` &gt; `New Directory` &gt; `R Package`.
- Check the box `Create a git` to set up a local git.

### Option 2: `usethis`

- Use `usethis::create_package()`, which will set up a template package directory in the specified folder.
- You have to take care of version control yourself (recommendation: initiate project on GitHub first).
]

.pull-right-wide3[
### Example


```r
R&gt; create_package("overviewR", open = FALSE)
```

```r
✓ Creating 'overviewR/'
✓ Setting active project to '/Users/simonmunzert/github/intro-to-data-science-21/lectures/10-debugging-automation/overviewR'
✓ Creating 'R/'
✓ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: overviewR
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last &lt;first.last@example.com&gt; [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
✓ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
✓ Writing 'overviewR.Rproj'
✓ Adding '^overviewR\\.Rproj$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✓ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✓ Adding '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✓ Setting active project to '&lt;no active project&gt;'

# Step 3: Fill your package with life

.pull-left-small3[

### Adding functions
The folder **R** contains all your functions and each function is saved in a new R file where the function name and the file name are the same. 

In the preamble of this file, we can add information on the function. This information will be used to render the help files.

### Example

```txt
#' @title overview_tab
#'
#' @description Provides an overview table for the time and scope conditions of
#'     a data set
#'
#' @param dat A data set object
#' @param id Scope (e.g., country codes or individual IDs)
#' @param time Time (e.g., time periods are given by years, months, ...)
#'
#' @return A data frame object that contains a summary of a sample that
#'     can later be converted to a TeX output using \code{overview_print}
#' @examples
#' data(toydata)
#' output_table &lt;- overview_tab(dat = toydata, id = ccode, time = year)
#' @export
#' @importFrom dplyr "%&gt;%"

# Step 6: Install your package!

.pull-left-small3[

### Installing a local package
We are now ready to load a developmental version of the package. This works with `devtools::install()`, which will also try to install dependencies of the package from CRAN, if they're not already installed.

You need to run this from the parent working directory that contains the package folder.

We're now ready to call functions from the package.
]

.pull-right-wide3[
### Example


```r
R&gt; install("overviewR")
```

```r
✓  checking for file ‘/Users/simonmunzert/github/intro-to-data-science-21/lectures/10-debugging-automation/examples/overviewR/DESCRIPTION’ ...
─  preparing ‘overviewR’:
✓  checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ...
─  checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts
─  checking for empty or unneeded directories
   Omitted ‘LazyData’ from DESCRIPTION
─  building ‘overviewR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz’
   
Running /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R CMD INSTALL \
  /var/folders/38/fqbc3hzd0rl23h350bh27_540000gp/T//RtmpAuLJL4/overviewR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz \
  --install-tests 
 installing to library ‘/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1-arm64/Resources/library’
 installing *source* package ‘overviewR’ ...
 testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location
 testing if installed package can be loaded from final location
 testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path
 DONE (overviewR)
```
]

# Steps 3-6

&lt;br&gt;
We skipped a couple of important (and some optional) steps now, including: 

- Build and check a package, clean up → `devtools::check()`
- Iterative loading and testing → `devtools::load_all()`
- Adding unit tests → `usethis::use_testthat()`
- Import functions from other packages (CRAN package dependency) → `usethis::use_package()`
- Git version control and collaboration → `usethis::use_github()`
- Add a proper public description → `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`
- Build PDF manual → `devtools::build_manual()`
- Add vignettes → `usethis::use_vignette()`
- Add a licence → `usethis::use_gpl_license()`, `usethis::use_mit_license()`, ...
- Convert into a single bundled file (binary or zipped) → `devtools::build()`
- Submit to CRAN → `devtools::release()`
- Build website for your package → `pkgdown::build_site()`

Be sure to check out the [motivating example](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/#subsection4-3) and more resources (next slide).

# Writing R packages - FAQ

.pull-left[
### Is learning this worth the time?

Yes.

### Where can I learn more?

Glad that you're asking! There's tons of materials out there. Apart from the used [tutorial](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/article/r-package/) and the [R packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/), have a look at the [devtools cheatsheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/package-development.pdf) and another overview over at [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-the-RStudio-IDE). Knowing how to [turn a package into a website](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/dev/) within minutes is fascinating, too. 

### When do we need a package, and when is a GitHub repo simply enough?

Do you think of your work as a project or a product? If it's the latter, maybe a package is right for you. (But... a research paper is also a product, right? 🤯)
